  I am Yueqi, a second-year graduate student at Zhejiang University, working under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=bPJgdNIAAAAJ">Prof. Di Chen</a>. My research interests focus on post-transcriptional regulation in early embryonic development, human embryonic stem cell pluripotency, and the application of bioinformatics methods in early embryonic development research. I am always open to academic collaborations and discussions in the fields of stem cell biology, developmental biology, and bioinformatics.
